### TODO: explain how `spry.d` fits in

- Purpose: `spry.d` acts as a drop-in _distribution_ directory for modular,
  extendable annotation, route, breadcrumbs, and other generated files.
- Contents: Inside `spry.d`, you can have SQL, JSON, or other files that Spry
  generates and it becomes available to SQLPage.
- Role: These files are not just ‚Äúextras‚Äù ‚Äî they‚Äôre actually required at runtime
  by SQLPage as part of its normal distribution.

So instead of one giant config or schema, SQLPage can simply read everything in
`spry.d` and use those pieces together. This makes the setup clean, modular, and
easy to extend ‚Äî exactly in line with the `.d` convention elsewhere on Linux.

When SQLPage starts up it sees `spry.d/` as just another directory where it can
pick up web contents.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `spry.d` is not meant for _non_-spry content because it's deleted
  recursively and recreated each time the build occurs. It's basically a
  _distribution_ directory. It's not safe for project-level files, it's for
  `spry` only.
- üëâ If you want to do something similar for your project you can create
  `project.d` similarly and manage it on your own.

### Why this is useful for SQLPage

1. Modularity ‚Äì You can drop in new SQL or JSON snippets without touching core
   SQLPage code.
2. Extendability ‚Äì Developers can add functionality just by generating files in
   `spry.d`.
3. Runtime requirements ‚Äì Since SQLPage needs these generated files to function
   properly, `spry.d` ensures they‚Äôre always available and loaded consistently.
4. Convention ‚Äì Following the familiar `.d` pattern makes it easier for Linux
   users/admins to understand what‚Äôs going on.

‚úÖ In short: `spry.d` is SQLPage‚Äôs drop-in _distribution_ directory. Whatever
goes in there (SQL, JSON, or other generated artifacts from Spry) becomes part
of the runtime environment for SQLPage under the web path `/spry.d/**`. It‚Äôs the
same modular, extendable configuration approach you see with `conf.d`, just
applied to SQLPage‚Äôs distribution.

WIP

- [ ] Convert `auto.json` or any other file generators to their `*.json.ts`
      counterparts to remove dependencies. for example,
      `spry/lib/forest.d/spry.auto.json` would come from
      `spry/lib/forest.d/spry.json.ts` in "capturable executable" style
      (emitting STDOUT, for example) but excluded from `package.sql.ts` when
      built. for example, `spry/templates/abc.handlebars.ts` would generate
      `spry/templates/abc.handlebars` during build `orchestrate.ts build` and
      then get picked up by package.json. Same for `*.sql.ts`, etc.
- [ ] Support mix of SQLite and PostgreSQL in the same `app` (annotations, file
      extensions, file names, etc.)
- [ ] Use `on_connect.sql` to initialize the `app` (add annotations for truly
      dynamic)
- [ ] Add experiment to generate and insert a new page in `sqlpage_files` and
      then redirect to it
- [ ] Consider how to integrate RUNME.md (as replacement for package.sql.ts?)
- [ ] Create `lib/route/mod.auto.sql` which is a partial that is included in
      SQLPage for constants
- [ ] Build a FUSE layer for browsing sqlpage_files and any RSSD
- [ ] Explain working with SQLPage "live reload" (symlink `std` to CWD/`spry`
      and start sqlpage); use watchexec
- [ ] Add `lint` CLI command to check if `page` types have typical includes
      (shell, etc.)
- [ ] [Introduce Middleware into Spry](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/discussions/584)
- [ ] [Introduce Custom Layout](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/blob/main/sqlpage/templates/shell.handlebars)
      [(discussion)](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/discussions/731)
- [ ] [HTMLx integration](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/discussions/628)
- [ ] [Consider dynamic search pages through codegen](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/discussions/699)
