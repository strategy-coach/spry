# @spry.nature foundry @spry.isCleanable
#
# üëÜ Two things make Spry notice this file:
#   1. The file has its "executable bit" set (`chmod +x`), so the OS can run it.
#   2. The `spry.nature foundry` annotation above tells Spry this is a
#      executable (Foundry) that should be included in the build.
#
# Spry will automatically scan source files for these annotations. It uses
# the shared `/lib/universal/content` module to read and understand them.
# That module knows how to parse annotations from many types of files, not
# just Bash scripts. Check the README in that library if you need details on
# how annotation scanning works.
#
# üîÑ Auto-materialization:
#   - When Spry runs this file, anything it prints to STDOUT is captured.
#   - If the file name follows the pattern <basename>.<nature>.<runner>
#     (for example: `debug-foundry.env.sh`), Spry will automatically
#     write the output into a file named <basename>.auto.<nature>
#     (for example: `debug-foundry.auto.env`).
#   - This is the simplest way to produce build artifacts from a Foundry.
#   - If the file is auto-materialized and spry.isCleanable is set, it can be
#     deleted during a `clean` operation.
#   - If the file is not auto-materialized and spry.isCleanable is set, then
#     FOUNDRY_DESTROY_CLEAN env var will be set to 'TRUE' and the cap exec
#     can decide what to do.
#
# üóÇÔ∏è Custom file outputs:
#   - You are not limited to auto-materialization. Foundrys can also write
#     their own single or multiple files wherever they need to.
#   - Spry passes a set of `FOUNDRY_*` environment variables that tell you
#     the proper destinations (for example, the SQLite database file path
#     or the auto-materialize path).
#   - Your script can choose to ignore auto-materialization and instead
#     create files in those locations manually.
#
# In short: this file demonstrates the auto-materialization convention,
# but Foundrys are free to manage their own outputs too. Either way, Spry
# integrates the results into the build pipeline.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This debug-foundry.env.sh Foundry script exists only as a teaching tool.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   - Show which FOUNDRY_* environment variables Spry injects into a Foundry.
#   - Demonstrate how to flatten complex JSON env vars like FOUNDRY_SOURCE
#     and FOUNDRY_CONTEXT_JSON into human-readable key=value lines.
#   - Confirm that Spry auto-materialization works: because this script follows
#     the <basename>.<nature>.<runner> pattern (e.g. debug-foundry.env.sh),
#     its stdout is automatically captured into a generated
#     <basename>.auto.<nature> file during the build.
#
# Key points:
#   - The script does not mutate anything in your project; it only prints.
#   - Output is dynamic (reflecting the current orchestration context).
#   - This is a non-TypeScript Foundry, proving that any language/runtime
#     capable of running as an executable can participate in the Spry pipeline.
#   - The resulting auto-materialized file becomes part of Spry‚Äôs reproducible
#     build artifacts alongside SQLPage content.
#
# In short:
#   This script is a simple "debug viewer" that lets you understand what
#   environment variables and context Spry provides to Foundrys, while showing
#   how non-TypeScript sources integrate seamlessly into the orchestration flow.

# This output was produced by a Foundry script that runs as part of the Spry
# orchestration pipeline. It demonstrates:
#
#   ‚Ä¢ Which FOUNDRY_* environment variables the Spry engine makes available.
#   ‚Ä¢ How FOUNDRY_SOURCE and FOUNDRY_CONTEXT_JSON can be flattened into
#     deterministic key=value pairs for inspection.
#   ‚Ä¢ That even a non-TypeScript Foundry (here, a Bash script) can generate
#     dynamic, auto-materialized output fully integrated into the Spry build.
#
# The contents below are not static: each run reflects the current Spry
# orchestration context. This file is auto-materialized by Spry following the
# <basename>.auto.<nature> naming convention, so you can check it into source
# control for reproducibility or inspect it to debug orchestration state.
